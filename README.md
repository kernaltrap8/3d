# 3d
3D game engine written entirely in C++ while using the minimal amount of libraries as possible
# Building
Just run `make`. Its that easy. Its not rocket science. Oh yeah, by the way, this is Linux only. Windows can suck it. Yeah, I said it. Fuck you Jeff Bezos.
# Required libraries
`x11-libs` - Subject to change, used to spawn the main window<br>
`vulkan-libs` - Main graphics renderer<br>
`SDL` - Subject to change, will be used for input handling<br>
